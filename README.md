# PROJECT TITLE

Performing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes Algorithm to Predict the Accuracy of the Data Model

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

User has been thinking that maybe SVM and Naïve Bayes model might produce better results for the dataset, "drugdataset.csv". 

In the favor of this statement, analysis has been performed using both SVM and Naïve Bayes thereby concluding which algorithm contributes to worthier outcomes.

# REFERENTIAL DATASET

The dataset used for this analysis is, “drugdataset.csv” which contains the following variables:


Independent Variables:

Age

Sex - (0 For Male, 1 For Female)

BP - Blood Pressure Level (0 For Normal, 1 For Low, 2 For High)

Cholesterol - Cholesterol Level (0 For Normal, 1 For High)

Na_to_K - Sodium To Potassium Ratio


Dependent Variable:

Drug: Drug Type In System(drugA, drugB, drugC, drugX, drugY)

# PRE-REQUISITES - SOFTWARES

Anaconda3 2021.05

Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0

# PRE-REQUISITES - PYTHON CODE EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS

Import the Library Packages - pandas, numpy, matplotlib

Load the Dataset - drugdataset.csv

# CODE DEPLOYMENT

1) Create X and Y variables for prediction
2) Classify the dataset into test and train data
3) Perform data pre-processing such as scaling the data
4) Implement SVM Algorithm for the dataframe
5) Implement Naïve Bayes Algorithm for the dataframe
6) Extract the Confusion Matrix for the results generated
7) Interpret the Accuracy, Precision and F1 Scores to evaluate which model produces better results

# IMPLEMENTATION FINDINGS

Comparison between SVM and Naïve Bayes Algorithm results and assess the Accuracy, Precision and F1 Scores to provide a verdict on which model yields good outcomes
